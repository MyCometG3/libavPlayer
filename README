libavPlayer.framework is MacOS X framework for media playback using libav*.
- NSOpenGLView subclass
- CAOpenGLLayer subclass
Derived from ffplay.c in ffmpeg project.

This is Free software under GPL V2. 
(Not LGPL V2.1 because it contains my GPL based 422-420 converter code.)

How to build:
* Setup git and yasm 1.2.x environment. The Macports is easy solution.
* NOTICE: This build requires Mavericks+Xcode 5.0 or later.

* Get latest ffmpeg from ffmpeg project.
  $ git clone git://git.videolan.org/ffmpeg.git
* Rename ffmpeg folder as libav.
* Place libav folder in same folder with libavPlayer.xcworkspace/libavPlayer/LAVPTest.
* Build "build_libav" target with Xcode.
* Build "all" target with Xcode.

NOTE: Building "all" target will copy stripped libavPlayer.framework into /Library/Framework/.
